odbToMat
========

Outputs Abaqus odb information to MATLAB mat file. Designed with the intention of performing data analysis on Abaqus results using MATLAB. Uses the SciPy 0.7 library from scipy.org. This is [an example](http://example.com/ "Title")

What it does:
========

1) Outputs assemlby and part information (nodes, elements) from Abaqus odbs to mat files.
2) Outputs field outputs from odb to mat. Field outputs are broken down by instance as well as combined into one matrix.
3) Attempts to replicate odb structure in MATLAB.
